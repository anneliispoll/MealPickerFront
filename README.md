# MealPickerFront

This is a React web application which is a front-end side to my back-end side Java project MealPickerFinal, which can be found [here](https://github.com/anneliispoll/MealPickerFinal). It's my final project to SDA Java course. 

*Disclaimer: I haven't really learn React, so please, don't take this code as a best practise or final truth. This is my first React project ever, without learning React, or having skills on the front-end side. Thanks!

## About the MealPicker

Idea to create MealPicker application came from a real life. Our family always struggled with the question "What should we eat?" We usually do grocery shopping once a week and we always have basics at home, but what should we cook? Should we make lasagne or pasta bolognese.. or chilli con carne? We know how to cook, so we didn't need a recipes but rather a desicion maker. And this what this application does - it tells you what you should eat. 

You can add your own meals to the database and MealPicker chooses randomly between those. You can also choose between the time and season. As we all prefer different things on different seasons. 

## How to start React application
1. Open your terminal and then type:

git clone {the url to the GitHub repo}

2. This clones the repo

cd into the new folder and type

npm install

This installs the required dependencies

3. To run the React project.
npm start

## What you will get

If you don't have an account, then you first need to register. Without logging in, user is not able to pass the main page or the login/registering form. Login and Registering page uses a toggle form.

After successful login, you are taken to the MealPicker application, where you can give your inputs to the program to make the decision - what to eat - for you.
